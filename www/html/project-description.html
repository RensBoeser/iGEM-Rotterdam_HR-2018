    <h1>Picture I: Seriousness of Carbon Monoxide Hazard Throughout Industry</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">Carbon monoxide is universally present in industry. Partial oxidation of
      compounds which contain carbon results in the production of carbon monoxide. With the lack of enough oxygen it is
      formed instead of carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas and therefore does not <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/2/26/T--Rotterdam_HR--Indexplaatje1.jpeg"
        style="width: 280px; height: 300px; float:right">give any warning of its presence to those exposed.
      Physiologically, carbon monoxide acts by displacing oxygen from the haemoglobin molecule. When encountered it
      is toxic for humans in concentrations as low as 35 ppm. This is because haemoglobin has an affinity for the
      poisonous gas that is 210 times higher compared to oxygen. High blood level concentrations of the compound
      prevents sufficient amounts of oxygen from reaching vital organs. In America alone several thousand workers die
      each year from carbon monoxide exposure, making it one of the most dangerous industrial hazards.</p>

      will dissolve. The bacteria in the system synthesize the receptor protein CooA, a member of the cAMP receptor
      protein family, which functions in a similar way as haemoglobin. Besides its capacity to bind carbon monoxide,
      the CooA protein also functions as a transcription factor. Therefore, CooA will not only detect the carbon
      monoxide from the polluted area, but also regulate the rate of an output signal.</p>

      gas. The medium is flanked by two electrodes that produce a constant electrical current through the medium. When
      the CO<sub>2</sub> gas production reaches a certain threshold, gas will accumulate and replace the medium at the
      location between the two electrodes. This results in a change in the resistance between the electrodes. Detection
      of the changing resistance by the hardware will set off an alarm.</p>

    <h1 class="title" style="font-size: 50px;">Selective Carbon Monoxide Detection</h1>
    <p>This project is focussed on manufacturing a carbon monoxide detection system. Despite the fact that there are
      already detection systems for carbon monoxide on the market. There is nothing wrong with the sensitivity of the
      present-day detection systems. However, carbon monoxide detectors that are used in various industries have
      difficulty in differentiating between carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. Because hydrogen gas is a by-product in
      many industries, this interference problem can result in many false alarms. </p>

    <h1>The CooA Protein</h1>
    <p>In order to create a device that can selectively detect carbon monoxide in a biological pathway, it is crucial
      to have a protein that can sense carbon monoxide molecules. The receptor protein CooA, a member of the cAMP
      receptor protein (CRP) family, is such a protein. In nature this heme-containing CooA protein is synthesised by
      the bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum and functions in a similar way as haemoglobin. Besides its capacity to bind to
      CO, the CooA protein also functions as a transcription factor. When a CooA protein binds to a carbon monoxide
      molecule it alters its own structure. Due to this change in structure the CooA receptor can bind to a specific
      DNA sequence: a CooA-dependent promotor. In the R. rubrum bacteria the location of the CooA-binding site on the
      DNA forms the foundation for the transcription of the cooFSCTJ and cooMKLXUH operons, which code for the
      synthesis of proteins that oxidize CO to CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, in R. rubrum bacteria CooA regulates the rate of
      the transcription of the genetic information that encodes for proteins that allow growth of this organism on CO
      as a sole energy source.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Gas detection"></a>
    <h1>Gas Detection and Gas Production</h1>
    <p>For a CO detection system the binding of CO to the CooA protein has to initiate the transcription of proteins
      that can deliver an output signal, instead of the original mechanism where proteins are synthesised that can
      oxidize CO to CO<sub>2</sub>. As a replacement for the original operons, a gene was ligated into the DNA sequence
      that enables the synthesis of the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc). Accordingly, pdc can convert the pyruvate
      that is present in the medium into CO<sub>2</sub> and acetaldehyde. The released CO<sub>2</sub> gas in the medium
      will be collected in a compartment where a constant electrical current goes through. As a result, the medium in
      the compartment will be replaced by the produced CO<sub>2</sub> gas. When a certain threshold is reached in the
      amount of produced gas a change in the resistance will occur, which can be detected by the hardware. Minimal
      concentrations of carbon monoxide in unpolluted air already result in the production of CO<sub>2</sub> gas that
      can add up and eventually reach the threshold. Therefore it was also necessary to design a constant draining
      system.</p>
    <p>Other output signal molecules were taken into consideration as well. For instance, producing an electrical
      signal by bacteria that release electrons which subsequently can be detected by the hardware. However, oxygen
      molecules in the medium can capture these released electrons. Designing an anaerobic environment to counter this
      problem resulted in additional complications.</p>
