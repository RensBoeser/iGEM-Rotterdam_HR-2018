	<h1>Carbon Monoxide</h1>
	<p>Carbon monoxide is a colourless and odourless gas so a detector is necessary to notice its presence. Our product is mainly focused on the steel industry. To make a Carbon Monoxide detector with bacteria inside it, it is important to focus on safety aspects and the efficacy of our product. That is why we communicate with experts on gas detection, possible buyers and other influential stakeholders. On this page you will find everything we did to make our product fit in the community. </p>

			<h1>The Das Conference</h1>
			<h3><i>March 30th 2018</i></h3>
			<p>
				We went to the DAS conference, this conference is a meeting for everyone working inside an institution that
				provides education for laboratory studies. Our goal on this event was to provide information about iGEM through the
				Netherlands and make contacts with specialist. These specialist gave mini presentations in which we learned about
				sensors, chips and chemical processes.
				We also present our top 3 ideas by handing out brochures, in which we received feedback and input for improvement
				our additions. We were very happy to make contacts and carry out the iGEM competition through the Netherlands.

			<h1>Nationale carière beurs (National Career fair)</h1>
			<h3><i>April 6th 2018</i></h3>
			<p>
				Today we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam. This is a big Dutch event where more than 120 employers
				gather to expose their company to a bigger audience and share contact information with potential recruits and
				interns. We had hoped to familiarize some relevant companies to iGEM along with trying to attain some sponsors.
				Sadly the event was primarily focused on IT companies with a very small chemical company presence and nothing
				biology related. Despite this it was a valuable team bonding experience.

				After we went to the National Career Event in Amsterdam, we thought that it might be helpful if we'd go to more
				events. Today we went to the BCF (biology, chemistry and pharmacy) in Utrecht to promote our project. The BCF
				career event is an event just like the one in Amsterdam but only for biology, chemistry and pharmacy. It was a nice
				day where we shared a lot of our business cards with the present companies.

				To spread more knowledge on what genetically modified organisms are and what they can do, we decided to do a
