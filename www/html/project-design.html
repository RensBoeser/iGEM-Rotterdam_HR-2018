      <h1 class="title" style="font-size: 50px;">The Carbon Monoxide Problem</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left !important">Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colorless and toxic gas which is known as
        the silent killer.<img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c7/T--Rotterdam_HR--CarbonMonoxide.png" style="width: 300px; height: 175px; float:right">
        There are already a lot of carbon monoxide detectors for the industry but they have a lot of
        interference with hydrogen gas. The detector can't see the difference between carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas,
        this results in false alarms and unsafe work environments. We decided to build a selective carbon monoxide
        detector without the interference of hydrogen gas.</p>

    <h1>How our constructs detect carbon monoxide</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">In our search <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/9/93/T--Rotterdam_HR--CooA.png"
        style="width: 440px; height: 320px; float:right">to find a means to detect carbon monoxide we learned about the
      transcription factor CooA, a heme-group containing protein normally made by Rhodospirillum rubrum, which becomes
      active after binding to carbon monoxide (Shelver et al. 1997). Thus it becomes able to interact with the carbon
      monoxide regulated transcriptional units cooMKLXUH (also known as pCooM) and cooFSCTJ (also known as pCooF).
      Cloning these promoters so that they regulate reporter genes, ensures these reporters are only
      expressed when carbon monoxide is present.</p>

    <h1>How our biological constructs work together with our hardware</h1>
    <h2>Gas production</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">When CO is bound to CooA, the structure of CooA will change and this will
      bind with a CooA dependent promoter CooF or CooM. By placing a signal generating gene after CooF or CooM, this
      signal will only be expressed if carbon monoxide is present. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">We looked into bacteria which give an electrical signal but this is very
      difficult measuring since bacteria always give some electrical signal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">After <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/4/48/T--Rotterdam_HR--OmzettingPyruvate.png"
      style="width: 490px; height: 300px; float:right">this option we thought of other ways to produce a signal. We found
      some biobricks (K173003, K173013, K133071, K133116, K173013 etc.) which most likely produce CO2 if the required
      substrate is present. We used the genes coding for the enzymes: pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol
      dehydrogenase II (adhB). Pyruvate decarboxylase catalyses pyruvic acid to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide.
      Alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) catalyses the acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol.<img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/d/d3/T--Rotterdam_HR--Testbuis.png"
      style="width: 320px; height: 650px; float:right"></p>
    <h2>Gas measurement</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left !important"> Our initial idea was to have the bacteria produce electrons, which could be
      easily picked up by our hardware. Another upside was the relative short duration of the signal. Sadly we never
      were able to go through with this idea due to the fact that E.coli produces generates electrons after a (long)
      acclimation time. We did look to see if we could use the electron production of other Exoelectrogens to our
      advantage. But all of the bacteria had had these genes in their genome and not in the plasmid. Which made it
      impossible for us to modify. Due to this and and the uncertainty as to when the electrons are created in E.coli
      We've decided to drop working with electrons and work with the gas production.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">To measure the gas production, we collect the gas in a tube
      filled with medium, and after it hits a specific level of medium displacement, we release it in a controlled
      manner using a peristaltic pump. By measuring the interval between the tube filling two times, we can determine
      the amount of gas produced. Because we’re using a peristaltic pump, we can increase the accuracy of the
      measurement by releasing a smaller amount of gas. This makes the interval shorter, and allows us to make more
      measurements. For more information, visit our hardware page.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="evironment"></a>
    <h1>How our hardware control the environment</h1>
    <p>To make sure the only variable controlling the gas production is the concentration of carbon monoxide, we need
      to keep the other variables constant. To achieve this, we have made a device to keep the temperature stable and a
      device that will occasionally shake the tube containing the bacteria. This will make sure that the bacteria won't
      pile up on the bottom of the tube, which would cause a decrease in gas production.</p>

    <a name="killswitch and atp sensor"></a>
    <h1>Things we wanted to build</h1>
    <h2>Killswitch for the safety</h2>
    <p>To ensure the safety of our end product we wanted to take a look at biological containment. Our eye quickly fell
      on so called "kill-switches", genetic circuits capable of killing synthetic bacteria when they are not in the
      presence of certain chemicals.One of the most interesting kill switches we found is the Deadman Kill Switch (Chan
      et al. 2015), which seemed to be one of the most easily adaptable kill switches at the moment. Though kill
      switches generally have problem with staying active in successive generations. Considering these kill switches
      are generally lost upon successive generations (around ~140 generations, which translates to around 3 days using
      E.coli), we decided not to include a killswitch in our own constructs, though it would be a practical addition if
      this product would be used in a real environment.</p>
    <h2>ATP sensor for the bacteria</h2>
    <p>We wanted a way to make sure our bacteria live inside the hardware. We wanted this because a dead cell wouldn't
      give off a signal, which could lead to a false positive feeling of safety. A way to make sure a cell lives is by
      using an ATP sensor. A living cell produces ATP which can be used for processes inside the cell. When the
      bacteria carries an ATP sensor, ATP will bind to the sensor and will produces a fluorescent protein. A living
      cell will be fluorescent and can be detected. When there is a low concentration of living bacteria, a low output
      will be generated. The measured CO concentration can be corrected for the number of living bacteria</p>
