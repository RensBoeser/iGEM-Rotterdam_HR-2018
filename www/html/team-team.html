							How's it going? My name is Mike, I am currently in my second year pursuing Electrical Engineering at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.

I am eager to learn new things and hope to pick up some knowledge about synthetic biology and chemistry along the way. I think my knowledge in the field of electrical engineering will be useful to the project, as it will give a view from another perspective.

						<strong>PhD Molecular Microbiology</strong>

							I’m a biologist who, after obtaining my PhD focussed on molecular biology techniques to
							investigate cancer cells. After 20 years of working for Erasmus university Medical Centre in
							Rotterdam and its predecessors, I switched to teaching as senior lecturer at the Rotterdam
							University of Applied Science. I’m also involved in setting up research projects for the
							students, mostly concerning modern molecular biology tools (modern cloning techniques and
							CRISPR/Cas9 related projects).

						I'm a molecular microbiologist with experience in University and in the biotech company DSM, and have also worked in cancer genetics at the ErasmusMC medical centre.
						Within the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences I coordinate a research group of lecturers and students (LabAcademy) that perform applied projects.
						I love the ambitions and energy in the synthetic biology community and it's an honor to be able to support the Rotterdam iGEM team.

						<strong>Bachelor of Science</strong>

							I’m a research technician with a background in molecular biology.
							To be an integral part of the Hogeschool Rotterdam iGEM supervisor team gives me the unique chance to apply different facets of my knowledge as a former iGEM’er (2014).
							Additionally, it’s a challenge to use my technical knowledge to support and encourage the team to do their utmost.
							I see iGEM as a great (networking) opportunity for students from every discipline to have a multidisciplinary collaboration and broaden their knowledge.

							Looking forward to the World Championship Jamboree in Boston and see all the fascinating work again!
