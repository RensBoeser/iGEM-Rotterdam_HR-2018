    <p>To make sure the only thing influencing the gas production from the bacteria is the amount of carbon monoxide,
      we wanted to make a temperature controller. This will keep the temperature stable independent of the temperature
      outside the system (within a reasonable range, &plusmn;70 degrees Celius of target temperature). To achieve this,
      we used a peltier element with a control system of our own design.</p>

    <h1>Architecture</h1>
    <p>Building a complex system like a temperature controller is easier said than done. So, we first design the
      architecture of the system, thereby dividing the system into smaller parts and the interfaces between these
      parts. These parts can then be designed individually, as long as you keep their interfaces in mind, and be
      assembled afterwards.</p>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Peltier element"></a>
    <h1>Peltier element</h1>
    <p>The first step was selecting the peltier element, since all other parameters of the design depend on the
      specifications of this element. But first, WTF is a peltier element? A peltier element is an element that can
      move thermal energy by using electricity. As a side effect it also generate its own heat on the "hot" side. We
      selected an element that is capable of moving a 150 watts of thermal energy, the TEC1-12715. To work at full
      power, it requires 15 Amps at 15 Volts. This means it will also produce 225 watts of thermal energy. The combined
      thermal energy will be produced at the hot side is 375 watts. This means that when youâ€™re cooling the test tube,
      you also have to cool the peltier element.</p>
