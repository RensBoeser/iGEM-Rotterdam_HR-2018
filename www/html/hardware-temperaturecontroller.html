    <h1 class="title" style="font-size: 50px;">The idea</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">To make sure the only <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/1/16/T--Rotterdam_HR--ArchitectureHardware.png" style="width: 370px; height: 230px; float:right"> thing influencing the gas production from the bacteria is the amount of carbon monoxide,
      we wanted to make a temperature controller. This will keep the temperature stable independent of the temperature
      outside the system (within a reasonable range, &plusmn;70 degrees Celius of target temperature). To achieve this,
      we used a peltier element with a control system of our own design.</p>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Architecture"></a>
    <h1>Architecture</h1>
    <p>Building a complex system like a temperature controller is easier said than done. So, we first design the
      architecture of the system, thereby dividing the system into smaller parts and the interfaces between these
      parts. These parts can then be designed individually, as long as you keep their interfaces in mind, and be
      assembled afterwards.</p>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Peltier element"></a>
    <h1>Peltier element</h1>
    <p>The first step was selecting the peltier element, since all other parameters of the design depend on the
      specifications of this element. But first, WTF is a peltier element? A peltier element is an element that can
      move thermal energy by using electricity. As a side effect it also generate its own heat on the "hot" side. We
      selected an element that is capable of moving a 150 watts of thermal energy, the TEC1-12715. To work at full
      power, it requires 15 Amps at 15 Volts. This means it will also produce 225 watts of thermal energy. The combined
      thermal energy will be produced at the hot side is 375 watts. This means that when you’re cooling the test tube,
      you also have to cool the peltier element.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Power supply"></a>
    <h1>Power supply</h1>
    <p>Because the system will use over 225 watts, we used a standard PC power supply. Because designing a power supply ourselves would be an entire project on its own. These PC power supplies can deliver this amount of power easily, albeit at 12 Volts. It also has built-in 3.3 and 5 Volt power supplies, which we use to power the logic of our controller.</p>

    <a name="DC-DC Converter"></a>
    <h1>DC-DC Converter</h1>
    <p>But how do we get 15 Volts from 12 Volts? For this purpose, we designed a DC-DC boost converter using the TPS43061. This will convert 12V at 18.75A to 15V at 15A. A DC-DC boost converter, converts a direct current into a direct current and boosts the voltage, hence why it’s called a boost converter.</p>

    <h1>Temperature sensors</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left !important">To measure the the internal and external <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/2/26/T--Rotterdam_HR--Tempkabel.png" style="width: 370px; height: 230px; float:right">temperature of the case we needed something to measure with. For this we choose the DS18B10, which is a digital temperature sensor with a measuring range from -55℃ to 125℃.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-container">
    <a name="Fan control"></a>
    <h1>Fan control</h1>
    <p>As we cool the environment of the bacteria down, by transporting the heat from this environment to the outside environment, we need to dissipate this heat. We achieve this by thermally connecting a heatsink to the opposite side of the Peltier element. Passive cooling alone will not suffice, so we needed a fan to actively dissipate this heat and hooked it up to the heatsink. </p>
