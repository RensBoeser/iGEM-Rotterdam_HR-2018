  <h1>Wiki Statistics</h1>
  <p>
    As a team interested in building a good wiki we liked to know which iGEM team pages were the most popular.
    To get the best data for inspiration, we made a web application for ranking all teampages by views.
    Using this application we can search for the current best pages.
    There is even an option to filter for a certain team and/or subpage.
    Of course, this application is now publically available on our wiki!
    We find this application helpful and we hope other iGEM teams will use it to better their own wiki.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are currently storing all viewdata of the day on a remote server.
    In a future update, we want to use this gathered data to show graphs and other analytics.
    All if we have the time to build such a program. 
    If you are interested, you can find the raw viewdata <a href="http://www.tevd.nl:81/">here (JSON format)</a>.

  <h1>Notebook Generator</h1>
  <p>
    As a team with only one computer scientist, we wanted a notebook that automatically updates whenever someone adds something to our lab journal.
    Luckily, we gained a sponsor that gave use an electronic lab journal as sponsorship.
    With this, we can use their API to download specific sections from our lab journal and display them on or wiki.
    But, as a multidisciplinary team we have multiple kinds of notebook entries: Software, Hardware and Wetlab.
    Therefore we also used google sheets for filling in software and hardware entries.
    <br>
    For gathering all our entries we used the following programs:

      <h1>Google Drive Entries</h1>
      <p>
        For our software and hardware notebook entries we built a program using the Google RESTful API.
        It downloads excel sheets from our Google Drive containing notebook entries and turns them into JSON files.
      </p>

      <h1>eLabJournal Entries</h1>
      <p>
        For our wetlab notebook entries we built a program using the eLabJournal API.
        This API allows for downloading sections from our electronic lab journal as JSON files.

    <h1>Notebook Builder</h1>
    <p>
      After downloading all the entries as JSON files, they need to be converted into actual HTML code for our wiki page.
      This is done by the Notebook Generator program.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the program needs to take the entries and turn them into html code individually.
      This is done by filling a template with the right data.
      Afterwards the individual entries are put inside a page with the additional content like specific filters.

  <h1>Page Builder</h1>
  <p>
    To make it easier for us to develop our wiki, we built a program that takes naked html code and adds a dynamic header and footer to it.
    This way we have files only containing content for the page, which are then transformed into a full webpage.
