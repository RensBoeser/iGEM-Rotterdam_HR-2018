    <h1>Replicating the experiments</h1>
    <p>If we would do our experiments again, we would start the change by performing our digestions in a smaller end volume, so we can get a more concentrated digest product, enabling us to use more nanograms of DNA when performing our ligation. Secondly we would like to sequence our intermediate constructs, as most parts we wanted to use are fairly small, and thus they donâ€™t make a significant enough change in construct length to easily and reliably detect on an electrophoresis gel. So as to be sure that our intermediate constructs are as we want them to, sequencing would be the most reliable method.</p>

    <h1>Future plans</h1>
    <p>If we want to make a fully usable product firstly we would have to finish our CooA production plasmid. Secondly we would like to look at a cell-free system, probably by altering the CooA structure, to avoid regulations regarding GMOs outside of a laboratory setting. This would also mean a relatively simpler hardware design, cutting down costs and the amount of work. If a cell-free system is not feasible we could also give more thought to safety measures, adding a working kill switch to our system, and also pursuing possible hardware contingency plans (like releasing toxic substances in our system when part of it breaks).</p>

    <h1>Sequencing and shipping</h1>
    <p>We sequenced the previously mentioned gas production parts and CooA 8 (refer to figure: 2). When comparing the sequencing results to the expected sequences we concluded that B1, B6,D1, I1 and J1 were as we expected.
        These BioBricks were then digested and ligated into pSB1C3, after which we transformed them, mini prepped them, and dried the DNA onto a 96 wells plate for submission. 70px
